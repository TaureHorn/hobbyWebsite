        <p> The word volcano typically conjures some particularly violent and destructive images in peoples minds.
            Of fiery hills spewing smoke, ash and molten lava. While this is not untrue these destructive events are only a piece of the whole picture.
            Most of the time, volcanoes lie dormat, asleep. But beneath the surface grand forces of geology, chemistry and physics are at play.
