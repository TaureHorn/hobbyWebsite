            <p> Here are just a few shots of volcanoes on Sicily and the Aeolian Islands, off the west coast of Italy.
                I do not claim to be a good photographer, but some of these are pretty good.

            <figcaption class="container-dark">A video of the near continuous eruption of <em>Stromboli</em>. A very
                tiring climb, but definitely worth the
                view. It looked even more magnificent at night! As you can tell from the shaking view, it was kinda
                cold.</figcaption>

            <figcaption class="container-dark">A shot of the summit of <em>Mt Etna</em>. I was stood atop month old lava
                when taking this
                photo.
                Despite the wind and elevation, the still cooling lava made it rather warm! We weren't allowed closer
                than this
                to the summit due to the recent eruptions</figcaption>

            <figcaption class="container-dark">The crater of the Fossa cone of <em>Vulcano</em>. Just off to the side of
                this shot were a
                feature called
                fumaroles. A vent where volcanic gases escape. They were bright yellow, made of crystallised sulphur,
                reeked of
                rotten eggs. </figcaption>

                the picture you can
                see the
                mini-island <em>Vulcanello</em> formed by one of Vulcano's parasitic cones.</figcaption>
