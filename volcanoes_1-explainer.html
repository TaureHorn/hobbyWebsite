                we stand and the rocks beneath our feet.
                This is in constrast to the inner layers of molten and semi-molten material that make up the internal
                layers of the earth.
                But thats a little out of the scope of volcanoes.

            <h4> Lava, ash and gas</h4>
            <hr>
            <p id="lava"> Following on with the definition, lava, ash and gases escape from volcanoes. Lava is molten or
                partially
                molten rock that has been exposed at the earths surface. If if is not exposed, and is still underneath
                the ground, we call this magma.
                Lava can differ a lot depending on its chemical makeup and quite how molten it is. These differences
                have profound effects on
                how the lava behaves which, in turn, affects much about the behaviour of the volcano as a whole.
                Detailed in the <a class="hyperlink" href="#volcano-types"> types of volcanoes </a> section.

            </p>
            <p id="ash"> Volcanic ash is a cloud of particles of lava mixed in with gases. When a volcano erupts
                explosively the
                force of the explosion causes the lava to blow apart into tiny shard of what is essentially glass. Lava
                is made
                up primarily of quartz, or silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), the same chemical elements as glass.
                When lava rapidly cools like it does with ash it forms a glass.
                You may be aware of obsidian, which is just lava that has cooled rapidly into a glassy texture and has
                not been
                exploded ito find ash. As the finer particles of ash get erupted it creates the impressive and iconic
                columns that rise high into the sky.
                Once ejected this ash slowly rains out of the sky or is carried away by wind to fall elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p id="gas"> Volcanoes also eject a large amount of gases. The vast majority of this gas is water vapour
                (H<sub>2</sub>O)
                and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), but a plethora of other gases are ejected in smaller amounts.
                One such gas is sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) which has a distinct smell of rotten eggs and can
                crystallise on the surface
                into distinctly yellow and brittle formations.
            </p>
            <p id="pyroclasm"> Particularly explosive eruptions create what is perhaps the most the most destructive
                volcanic phenomenon, the pyroclastic flow.
                An incredibly hot and fast avalanche of ash, gas and chunks of lava that sweeps down from atop the
                volcano
                and buries its
                surrounding landscape.

        <div id="magma chamber">
            <h4> Magma Chambers</h4>
            <hr>
            <p> All of these aforementioned products come from down within the earth, deep within the crust and even
                beyond in the
                inner layers of the earth. Magma rises through the crust and comes to rest somewhere beneath the
                volcano, usually within
                a few kilometres. Magma is not static, and goes through a lot of chemical and textural changes as it
                rises.
                But here, within the magma chamber, magma begins to really change. Chemical reactions occur as the magma
                begins to
                cool and crystals begin to grow. Gases also begin to separate out, rise through the magma and the
                volcanic system.
                It is the accumulation of gases and the arrival of new magma into the magma chamber that builds the
                energy that
                eventually gets released in an eruption.
            </p>

            <p> Where in the earth magma is sourced, and how it develops as it rises and rests in a magma chamber
                dictates a lot
                about the volcanoes behaviour, which in turn dictates the the volcanoes type.

        <div id="volcano-types">
            <h4> Types of volcanoes</h4>
            <hr>
            <p> There is no singular type of volcano. Each volcano has its own quirks, cycles and eruptive styles.
                However, generally volcanoes behave in predictable ways. Volcanoes are categorised by their eruptive
                explosivity,
                on a scale called the Volcanic Explosivity Index, or
                <a class="hyperlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_explosivity_index"> VEI</a>,
                which assigns a score between 1 and 8. While this scale directly measures the amount of lava and ash a
                volcano erupts,
                this is directly correlated with how explosive and freqeunt these eruptions are.
            </p>
            <p> A 1 on the VEI represents volcanoes that do not erupt explosively, called an effusive, or Hawaiian
                eruption. They typically
                erupt mostly a runny lava and erupt very frequently. Due to their predictability and low explosivity,
                they present relatively
                little danger. As a result of their relatively fast flowing lava these volcanoes are wide and fairly
                flat.
                Perhaps the most famous example of a volcano of this type is Kilauea in Hawaii which erupts almost
                constantly.
            </p>
            <p> On the other end of the VEI scale, at 8, are volcanoes that erupt very explosively, called colossal or
                ultra-plinian eruptions. They typically erupt all of the above prodcuts in a cataclysmically large and
                explosive eruption. Fortunately, these eruptions happen very infrequently. So infrequently that no
                eruptions of this
                magnitude are known to have happened within recorded human history. However, there are examples
                throughout the
                geological record. Perhaps the most famous of which is the eruption of Yellowstone in the US, which last
                erupted 640,000
                years ago. It has been theorised that if Yellowstone were to erupt today, it may lead to the extinction
                of the human race.
            </p>
            <p> As a point of reference, we can point to some of the more widely known historical volcanic eruptions.
                The 1980 eruption of Mt St Helens in the US,
                and the historical AD79 eruption of Mt Vesuvius, Italy - that famously buried the Roman city of Pompeii
                - are two famous explosive
                eruptions. Both of those eruptions are cateogorised as a 5 on the VEI scale.
