            <p> Volcanoes have had a marked impact on human history. While they have a reputation for violent explosive
                events and destruction, the history of volcanoes as it relates to humans is not all doom and gloom. Here
                we'll
                cover a few examples of ways in which volcanoes have impacted humans throughout history, both ancient
                and modern.

            <h4>Volcanoes and Agriculture</h4>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p> When most people think of volcanoes, they think of fire, destruction and calamity. They think of lava
                and ash that
                buries and level towns. But they do not realise the opportunities this material provides. The ash and
                lava that is
                erupted from a volcano usual spreads, down from the peak to the lower lying lands beneath. These
                eruptive products
                can spread for up to hundreds of miles in some cases. When these eruptive products have settled - or
                been deposited
                to use the scientific lingo - they slowly are affected by the forces of life and nature to become
                topsoil.
            </p>
            <p> Volcanic products are rich in a host of chemicals that can be useful to living organisms. Which of these
                chemicals are in abundance depends on the type of magma the volcano erupts
                (see <a class="hyperlink" href="volcanoes_1-explainer">What is a volcano?</a>)
                but broadly, volcanic products are rich in things such as;
            </p>
            <ul id="abundant-chemicals">
                <li>Iron <em>(Fe)</em></li>
                <li>Calcium <em>(Ca)</em></li>
                <li>Sodium <em>(Na)</em></li>
                <li>Potassium <em>(K)</em></li>
                <li>Magnesium <em>(Mg)</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p> Because of the abundance of their chemistry, soils that are made from the natural breakdown of volcanic
                products are especially nutritious for plant life. As a result, humans throughout the ages have had a
                lot of
                success with agriculture practiced in the shadow of volcanoes.
            </p>
            <p> Even with the advent of modern agricultural techniques, these soils remain useful and relevant. As an
                example, perhaps you know of, or have even tried, the popular Italian liqueur <em>limoncello</em>.
                Perhaps you
                did not know that one of the places famous for its lemons and limoncello is a town called Sorrento, in
                the Gulf of
                Naples. A place that farms soil made from the nutrient rich eruptive products of Mt. Vesuvius.
            </p>
            <p>Or take the island of Java, a large Indonesian island that is practically littered with volcanoes. Due to
                the climate, the geography and the rich soils sourced from volcanic products the area has ideal
                conditions for the
                cultivation of coffee. In fact, this place is so renowned for its coffee production it is where the
                nickname
                <em>Java</em> to refer to a cup of coffee came from. By entension, it is also responsible for the naming
                of the
                programming language Java!

                <p>Perhaps the most famous example of the death and destruction a volcano can wreak is the historical
                    eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in the year 79AD. This volcanic eruption spewed out ash and pyroclastic
                    flows in
                    several
                    surges over the course of two days. In so doing it destroyed and buried the ancient Roman towns of
                    Pompeii
                    and Herculeneum. Many of the inhabitants of these towns were buried by in ash and debris. These
                    inhabitants,
                    or at least the traces of them, have been unearthed from the ash. Either as skeletons well preserved
                    in the fine
                    ash, or simply as casts - the preserved outlines of these people in their final moments.
                </p>
                <p>Those killed in Pompeii and Herculeneum were likely killed by fast moving pyrocasltic flows,
                    pummelling and burying them
                    under volcanic debris. Those that escaped the intial surge of material were vaporised inside the
                    cloud of
                    hot ash at over 300Â°C as it swept through the town. In Pompeii a total of over 1000 casts of the
                    dead have been unearthed,
                    in addition to the bones of an estimated 100 people. In Herculeneum, the total number of remains
                    unearthed is over 300.
